# Appezite

## Overview
Appezite is a mobile application developed as a project during the second year of university studies. The primary aim of the app is to combat food waste by assisting users in managing their leftover food items and ingredients. By inputting the available ingredients, the app provides recommendations for recipes that utilize those ingredients, thereby encouraging users to create meals from what they already have rather than letting food go to waste.
